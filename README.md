I am currently auditing this class. The files contained in here have never been submitted for credit, and
so they do not represent my most diligent work. However, they do demonstrate my abilities with parallel
programming (processes, fork, exec, POSIX threads). I am also in the process of building a kernel for 
the Yalnix operating system, and will push those when they are complete.
